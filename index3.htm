<!--Alternatively rather than doing breaks, it's also possible to use the <pre></pre> element.
In that element it shows all the spaces and indents put into the text. This will however make the words italicized.-->

<!--The <em></em> elements are unnecessary, they are simply emphasis. They make words italicized for emphasis-->
<!--The <strong></strong> element is similar in that it emphasises.They make words bold. Completely optional.-->
<!--Another useful tool is <abbr title="***">words</abbr>. When highlighted, words will yield bonus info-->
